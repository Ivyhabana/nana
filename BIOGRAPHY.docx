                <p>                                                                Ivy Habana has many dreams in life, but she likes to overthink about her future, especially when she is alone she seems to be visited by sadness and full of overthinking for her future. When she is with her friends it seems she is full of motivation about her future, but that is how they know.
                    She was born on November 25, 2002 who lives in Saban Oas, Albay, she likes taking a picture about nature, also likes listening to music, also likes watching Korean dramas, and also she loves dancing, she also doing tiktoks but she doesn't want to upload it, maybe because she was afraid of what people would say, maybe she would be judged, so she chose to be the only one who could watch it.
                         She is now in his second year of college taking a course of Bachelor of Science Information System, actually this is not the degree she wants, but the BSN, but she just chose to continue and finish this course, at first she didn't seem happy with BSIS course but suddenly she loved his course and enjoyed it now. "Maybe God has a plan why I am here in this course"
                    that's what she says whenever she talks to herself. Of course, when she entered college, there were too many problems, especially the budget or allowance, sometimes she was ashamed to ask his sister or his parents. She waited for the vacation and went to Manila to be a salesman at his brother's sari sari store so that she could make extra money this school year, while she was on vacation in Manila she also talked to his best friend named Rica, she wondered about uploading products on tiktok, and his friend said that it was called affiliate, so she seemed to think that maybe being an affiliate would also add to his daily allowance. While she was walking around Manila, she seemed to like the background, as if there was peace and avoided overthinking about the future.She went through many good schools and universities like JRU, and ARELLANO </p>
